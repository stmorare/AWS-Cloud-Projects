## EXTRACT from Preface:
***This book’s approach is project-focused, with each chapter guiding you through the implementation of
real-world scenarios using AWS services. From setting up basic infrastructure to host a website to
leveraging advanced features such as serverless computing and machine learning to power a chatbot,
the projects in this book are tailored to equip you with the skills required to tackle the challenges you will
face in the field.***

Scenarios, examples, and the real-life projects within each chapters will make the most part of this repository, the theory making the less part of this learning journey. I enjoy training that paints a picture of how technology is being used in different industries, and this book offers such content.
